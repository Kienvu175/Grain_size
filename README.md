1. The basis : What is Grain size ?
    - Grain size refers to the size of individual crystal that make up a metalline material. These grains, crystal are building the blocks of materials. Their characteristics can profoundly influence the properties of the material as a whole. By understanding and controlling the grain size, materials engineers can optimize materials for specific applications.
    - Grain size can be measured by methods, but we chose Microstructure techniques

  The grain boundaries also can reflect incoming dislocations, and these reflected dislocations will interact with other dislocations resulting in a dislocation tangle which also impedes subsequent dislocation   
motion. Moreover, grain boundaries act as sources as well as sinks for vacancies, thereby affecting diffusion and other properties that can indirectly influence the strength of the material.
